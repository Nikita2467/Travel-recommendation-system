# Personalized-Travel-recommendation-system
## Objective:
The project aims to deliver a personalized travel plan encompassing accommodation, attractions, and dining recommendations tailored to the user's preferences. It provides a comprehensive itinerary featuring recommended restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, along with five potential lodging options and curated attraction suggestions based on optimal timing.

## Project Overview:
The system employs three distinct recommender systems:

RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) for Attractions
Matrix Factorization with ALS (Alternating Least Squares) for Hotels
Hybrid approach combining K-Means algorithm for Content-Based Filtering and K-Nearest Neighbors for Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering for Restaurants.
## Execution Steps:

For restaurant recommendations: Download the Yelp dataset from the Yelp dataset challenge and store it in the designated folder.
For hotel recommendations: TripAdvisor was scraped to gather the dataset, accessible from the tripadvisor_hotel_output folder.
For attraction recommendations: TripAdvisor data was also scraped and stored in the outputs folder.
## Resources:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations: Available in the EDA folder, created using Python libraries and Tableau software.
